					<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
					<p>
						I'm an undergraduate Computer Science student at the
						University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, with a passion for 
						software engineering and computer networking. I particularly
						enjoy the problem solving aspects, especially after
						solving an issue that has been giving me trouble.

					<p>
						I built my computer that I use day in and day out, including
						the custom watercooling loop that cools the CPU, with plans
						to include the graphics card in the loop later down the road.
						It's always a fun challenge to maintain the cooling system
						and make further additions to the system that has been a 
						work in progress for the past three years.
