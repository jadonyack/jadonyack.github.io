					<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
					<p>
						Hey! I'm Jadon, and I'm an undergraduate Computer Science student at the
						University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, with a passion for 
						software engineering and computer networking. I am also interested in 
						gaining knowledge in cloud computing and DevOps. In particular, I enjoy 
						the problem solving aspects, especially after solving an issue that has 
						been giving me trouble. Some of the coursework I've taken at U of M includes
						Computer Organization, Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Networks, 
						and Computer Security. During my senior year I will be taking Operating Systems
						and Web	Systems as my final two electives.

						<p>
							I built my computer that I use day in and day out, including
							the custom watercooling loop that cools the CPU, with plans
							to include the graphics card in the loop later down the road.
							It's always a fun challenge to maintain the cooling system
							and make further additions to the system that has been a 
							work in progress for the past three years. I chose the parts 
							primarily with gaming in mind, so a high-end graphics card and 
							processor were a must. These choices also allow me to stream
							my gameplay on Twitch, which was something I kept in mind while
							choosing parts. Soon after the initial build, I added more memory
							to the system in order to host game servers off of this computer,
							while still allowing me to use it without issue.
